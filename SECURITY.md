## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, I appreciate your help in disclosing it to me responsibly.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them privately by going to the **"Security"** tab of the repository and clicking on **"Report a vulnerability"**.

You should receive an acknowledgment of your report within **48 hours**. I will do my best to provide a more detailed response within a week, including an overview of the planned fix and timeline.

I appreciate your effort and will work with you to resolve the issue promptly.
